## Background / Context
The current EDA Chat Interface is a functional prototype with basic data analysis capabilities, AI integration, and simple visualizations. However, it lacks comprehensive data validation, statistical robustness, AI transparency, and quality assurance features that are essential for professional data analysis. Users cannot verify data quality, assess statistical reliability, or understand AI decision-making processes. This requirement addresses the transformation into a professional-grade, accuracy-focused data analysis platform.

## Objective
