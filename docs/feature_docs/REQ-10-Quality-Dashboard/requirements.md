## Date
January 11, 2025

## Background / Context
The current application lacks comprehensive data quality assessment and reporting capabilities. Users cannot systematically evaluate data quality, track quality improvements over time, or generate professional quality reports. This leads to uncertainty about data reliability and difficulty in communicating data quality status to stakeholders. This requirement addresses the need for a comprehensive data quality metrics system and professional reporting dashboard.

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive data quality metrics system and professional reporting dashboard that provides users with detailed quality assessments, trend analysis, and actionable insights for data quality improvement. Users should be able to monitor, report, and improve data quality systematically.

## Scope

### Included:
- Comprehensive data quality metrics calculation and scoring
- Professional quality reporting and dashboard visualization
- Data quality trend analysis and monitoring over time
- Automated quality improvement recommendations
- Exportable quality reports in multiple formats
- Quality metrics customization and threshold configuration
- Data quality benchmarking and comparison capabilities

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Real-time data quality monitoring (batch processing only)
- External data quality service integration (local processing only)
- Advanced machine learning for quality prediction (rule-based only)
- Automated data correction without user approval

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Quality Metrics System
The system must calculate and display comprehensive data quality metrics including completeness, consistency, uniqueness, accuracy, validity, and timeliness. Each metric must be clearly defined, measurable, and provide actionable insights.

### Requirement 2: Quality Dashboard & Visualization
The system must provide an interactive quality dashboard with visual representations of quality metrics, trend charts, quality scorecards, and drill-down capabilities for detailed quality analysis.

### Requirement 3: Quality Reporting & Export
The system must generate professional-quality data quality reports that can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, HTML). Reports must include executive summaries, detailed metrics, trend analysis, and improvement recommendations.

### Requirement 4: Quality Trend Analysis
The system must track data quality metrics over time, identify quality trends, detect quality degradation, and provide predictive insights about future quality issues.

### Requirement 5: Quality Improvement Recommendations
The system must provide intelligent recommendations for improving data quality based on identified issues, best practices, and historical quality patterns. Recommendations must be actionable and prioritized by impact.

### Non-functional requirement 2: Usability
- Quality dashboard must be intuitive and easy to navigate
- Quality metrics must be clearly explained and interpretable
- Reports must be professional and publication-ready
- Quality recommendations must be actionable and specific

### Non-functional requirement 3: Reliability
- Quality metrics must be consistent and reproducible
- Quality calculations must be mathematically sound
- System must handle edge cases and data anomalies gracefully
- Quality data must be preserved and never lost

### Non-functional requirement 4: Accuracy
- Quality metrics must accurately reflect actual data quality
- Quality scores must be well-calibrated and meaningful
- Trend analysis must identify real quality patterns
- Recommendations must be based on valid quality insights

## Acceptance Criteria
