## Title
Data Persistence & Session Management

## Author

## Background / Context
The current application has no data persistence capabilities - users lose all their work when they refresh the page or close the browser. There's no way to save analysis sessions, restore previous work, or maintain user progress across browser sessions. This creates a poor user experience and makes the application unreliable for professional use. This requirement addresses the fundamental need for data persistence and session management.

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive data persistence and session management system that allows users to save their analysis sessions, restore previous work, and maintain progress across browser sessions without losing any data or insights.

## Scope

### Included:
- Local storage integration for data persistence
- Session management and organization
- Auto-save and recovery functionality
- Storage optimization and cleanup
- Multiple session support
- Session metadata and organization
- Graceful storage limit handling

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Cloud storage integration (local storage only)
- Real-time synchronization (local only)
- Advanced backup systems (basic persistence only)
- Cross-device synchronization (single device only)

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Persistence
The system must automatically save all analysis data, results, charts, and conversation history to browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage). Data must persist across page refreshes and browser restarts.

### Requirement 2: Session Management
The system must provide comprehensive session management including session creation, naming, organization, and deletion. Users must be able to manage multiple analysis sessions effectively.

### Requirement 3: Auto-Save & Recovery
The system must implement automatic saving of user work with recovery capabilities. Users must be able to restore their previous sessions and continue working without data loss.

### Requirement 4: Storage Optimization
The system must implement efficient storage management including data compression, cleanup of old sessions, and graceful handling of storage limits. Storage usage must be optimized and monitored.

### Requirement 5: Session Restoration
The system must provide intuitive session restoration including session detection, preview of available sessions, and seamless restoration of analysis state. Users must be able to easily resume previous work.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Non-functional requirement 1: Performance
- Auto-save operations must not block the user interface
- Session restoration must complete within 2 seconds
- Storage operations must not impact application responsiveness
- Memory usage must remain reasonable for large datasets

### Non-functional requirement 2: Reliability
- Data persistence must be 100% reliable
- Session recovery must work consistently
- Storage failures must be handled gracefully
- Data integrity must be maintained at all times

### Non-functional requirement 3: Usability
- Auto-save must be transparent to users
- Session management must be intuitive and accessible
- Storage limits must be communicated clearly
- Recovery process must be simple and reliable

### Non-functional requirement 4: Storage Efficiency
- Storage usage must be optimized and compressed
- Old sessions must be automatically cleaned up
- Storage limits must be handled gracefully
- Data compression must be implemented for large datasets

## Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptance criterion 1: Data Persistence
- All analysis data is automatically saved
- Data persists across page refreshes
- Data persists across browser restarts
- No data loss occurs during normal operation

### Acceptance criterion 2: Session Management
- Users can create and name analysis sessions
- Multiple sessions can be managed simultaneously
- Sessions can be organized and categorized
- Session deletion and cleanup works correctly

### Acceptance criterion 3: Auto-Save & Recovery
- User work is automatically saved
- Recovery from interruptions works reliably
- Auto-save frequency is appropriate and non-intrusive
- Recovery process is fast and reliable

### Acceptance criterion 4: Storage Optimization
- Storage usage is monitored and optimized
- Data compression reduces storage requirements
- Old sessions are automatically cleaned up
- Storage limits are handled gracefully

### Acceptance criterion 5: Session Restoration
- Previous sessions are easily discoverable
- Session preview shows relevant information
- Restoration process is intuitive and fast
- Users can choose to start fresh or restore

## Dependencies / Impact

### Dependencies:
- Browser localStorage/sessionStorage APIs
- Existing data structures and types
- UI components for session management
- Storage and compression libraries

### Impact on Existing Codebase:
- App.tsx will need session management integration
- New session management components will be required
- Data services will need persistence integration
- UI will need session management interfaces

### Related Systems:
- Browser storage APIs
- Data processing and analysis services
- UI components and interfaces
- Storage optimization libraries

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Approach:
- Phase 1: Implement basic data persistence
- Phase 2: Add session management features
- Phase 3: Implement auto-save and recovery
- Phase 4: Add storage optimization and cleanup

### Technical Considerations:
- Implement efficient data serialization
- Use Web Workers for large data operations
- Implement proper error handling for storage failures
- Consider data compression for large datasets

### Future Considerations:
- Cloud storage integration
- Cross-device synchronization
- Advanced backup systems
- Real-time collaboration features

### Risk Mitigation:
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Test with various dataset sizes and types
- Monitor storage usage and performance
- Provide clear user feedback for storage operations
