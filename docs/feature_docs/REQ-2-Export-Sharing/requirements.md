## Title
Data Export & Sharing System

## Author

## Date

## Background / Context
Currently, users cannot export their analysis results, charts, or data from the application. This creates a significant limitation as users need to share their findings with colleagues, create reports, or save their work for future reference. The application lacks the ability to export data in common formats (CSV, Excel), save charts as images, or generate professional PDF reports. This requirement addresses the need for comprehensive data export and sharing capabilities.

## Objective
Implement a complete data export and sharing system that allows users to export their analysis results, visualizations, and data in multiple professional formats, enabling them to share insights, create reports, and preserve their work outside the application.

## Scope

### Included:
- CSV and Excel export functionality for raw and processed data
- Chart and visualization export as PNG and SVG images
- PDF report generation with professional formatting
- Shareable analysis links and session sharing
- Export progress indicators and user feedback
- Export customization options and templates
- Support for large dataset exports


## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Export (CSV/Excel)
The system must provide the ability to export data in CSV and Excel formats. Users should be able to export raw data, processed data, and analysis results. The export should handle large datasets gracefully and provide progress indicators for long operations.

### Requirement 2: Chart Image Export
The system must allow users to export charts and visualizations as high-quality images. Support should include PNG format for general use and SVG format for scalable graphics. Export should maintain chart styling and quality.

### Requirement 3: PDF Report Generation
The system must generate comprehensive PDF reports that include dataset overview, key statistics, visualizations, and AI-generated insights. Reports should have professional formatting and be suitable for business presentations.


## Non-Functional Requirements

### Non-functional requirement 1: Performance
- Export operations must not block the user interface
- Large dataset exports (1M+ rows) must complete within 30 seconds
- Chart export must complete within 5 seconds
- PDF generation must complete within 15 seconds

### Non-functional requirement 2: Quality & Reliability
- Exported data must maintain 100% accuracy
- Chart exports must preserve visual quality and styling
- PDF reports must be properly formatted and readable
- Export operations must handle errors gracefully

### Non-functional requirement 3: User Experience
- Export options must be clearly visible and accessible
- Progress indicators must show accurate completion status
- Success/error messages must be clear and actionable
- Export workflow must be intuitive and require minimal steps

### Non-functional requirement 4: Compatibility
- CSV exports must be compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, and other tools
- Excel exports must work with Microsoft Excel 2016+ and LibreOffice
- PNG exports must maintain quality across different devices
- SVG exports must be compatible with modern browsers and design tools

## Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptance criterion 1: CSV Export
- Users can export data to CSV format with proper encoding
- CSV files open correctly in Excel and other spreadsheet applications
- Large datasets export without memory issues
- Export includes all data columns and rows

### Acceptance criterion 2: Excel Export
- Users can export data to Excel (.xlsx) format
- Excel files open correctly in Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice
- Multiple sheets are created for different data types if applicable
- Cell formatting and data types are preserved

### Acceptance criterion 3: Chart Image Export
- Charts can be exported as PNG images with high resolution
- Charts can be exported as SVG files for scalable graphics
- Exported images maintain chart colors, fonts, and styling
- Export works for all chart types (bar, pie, scatter, etc.)

### Acceptance criterion 4: PDF Report Generation
- PDF reports include dataset overview and key statistics
- Reports include relevant charts and visualizations
- Reports have professional formatting and layout
- PDFs are properly formatted and readable

### Acceptance criterion 5: Export Management
- Export progress is clearly displayed to users
- Users can cancel long-running export operations
- Export history is maintained and accessible
- Clear feedback is provided for success/failure

## Dependencies / Impact

### Dependencies:
- Existing data processing and analysis functionality
- Chart rendering components (Recharts library)
- File handling capabilities (browser File API)
- Data structures and types from other requirements

### Impact on Existing Codebase:
- FileUpload.tsx will need export functionality integration
- Chart components will need export capabilities
- New export service will need to be created
- UI components will need export buttons and progress indicators

### Related Systems:
- Browser File API for file downloads
- jsPDF or similar library for PDF generation
- html2canvas or similar for chart image export
- Existing PapaParse and XLSX libraries for data export

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Approach:
- Phase 1: Basic CSV/Excel export functionality
- Phase 2: Chart image export capabilities
- Phase 3: PDF report generation
- Phase 4: Advanced export features and optimization

### Technical Considerations:
- Use Web Workers for large dataset exports to prevent UI blocking
- Implement streaming for very large files to manage memory
- Consider compression for large exports to improve download times
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed export operations

### Future Considerations:
- Cloud storage integration for automatic backup
- Email integration for direct sharing
- Advanced report templates and customization
- Export scheduling and automation

### Risk Mitigation:
- Test exports with various dataset sizes and types
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Provide fallback options for unsupported export formats
- Monitor export performance and optimize as needed
