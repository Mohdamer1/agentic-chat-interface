## Background / Context
The current application only supports basic bar and pie charts, which severely limits the types of data analysis and insights users can gain from their datasets. Users need more sophisticated visualization options including scatter plots, line charts, histograms, correlation matrices, and interactive features to properly analyze relationships, trends, and patterns in their data. This requirement addresses the need for a comprehensive, professional-grade charting library.

## Objective
Expand the visualization capabilities beyond basic charts to include advanced chart types, interactive features, and professional styling that enables users to gain deeper insights from their data through sophisticated visual analysis.

## Scope

### Included:
- Advanced chart types (scatter plots, line charts, histograms, box plots)
- Statistical visualizations (correlation matrices, heatmaps, treemaps)
- Interactive features (zoom, pan, drill-down, hover effects)
- Chart customization and theming options
- Responsive chart layouts for different screen sizes
- Chart export capabilities (PNG, SVG)
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Explicitly Excluded:
- 3D visualizations (future requirement)
- Real-time data streaming charts (future requirement)
- Custom chart creation tools (predefined chart types only)
- Advanced animation effects (basic transitions only)

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chart Type Expansion
The system must support at least 8 different chart types including scatter plots, line charts, histograms, box plots, correlation matrices, heatmaps, treemaps, and area charts. Each chart type must be automatically selected based on data characteristics or manually chosen by users.

### Requirement 2: Interactive Features
The system must provide interactive chart capabilities including zoom in/out, pan navigation, hover tooltips with detailed information, click-to-drill-down functionality, and chart element selection. These features must work seamlessly across all chart types.

### Requirement 3: Chart Customization
The system must allow users to customize chart appearance including colors, fonts, sizes, legends, axes, and overall themes. Users should be able to save and apply custom themes to maintain consistency across visualizations.

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design
The system must ensure all charts are fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and devices. Charts must maintain readability and functionality on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization
The system must handle large datasets efficiently without compromising chart rendering performance. Charts should render within 1 second for datasets up to 100,000 data points and maintain smooth interactions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Non-functional requirement 1: Performance
- Chart rendering must complete within 1 second for standard datasets
- Interactive features must respond within 100ms
- Large dataset charts (100K+ points) must render within 3 seconds
- Memory usage must remain under 200MB for chart operations

### Non-functional requirement 2: Quality & Reliability
- Charts must maintain visual quality across different devices and browsers
- Interactive features must work consistently across all chart types
- Chart exports must preserve all visual elements and styling
- Error handling must gracefully manage invalid or corrupted data

### Non-functional requirement 3: User Experience
- Chart selection must be intuitive and guided by data characteristics
- Interactive features must have clear visual feedback
- Customization options must be easily accessible and understandable
- Responsive behavior must be smooth and predictable

### Non-functional requirement 4: Compatibility
- Charts must work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile touch interactions must be smooth and responsive
- Chart exports must maintain quality across different applications
- Themes must be consistent across all chart types

## Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptance criterion 1: Chart Types
- At least 8 different chart types are available and functional
- Chart type selection is automatic based on data characteristics
- Manual chart type selection is available for all data types
- Each chart type displays data correctly and meaningfully

### Acceptance criterion 2: Interactive Features
- Zoom in/out functionality works smoothly on all chart types
- Pan navigation allows users to explore large datasets
- Hover tooltips display relevant data information
- Click interactions provide meaningful drill-down capabilities

### Acceptance criterion 3: Customization
- Users can modify chart colors, fonts, and sizes
- Theme selection and application works consistently
- Custom themes can be saved and reused
- Chart appearance adapts to user preferences

### Acceptance criterion 4: Responsiveness
- Charts adapt smoothly to different screen sizes
- Mobile touch interactions are intuitive and responsive
- Chart layouts adjust appropriately for different orientations
- Performance remains consistent across device types

### Acceptance criterion 5: Performance
- Standard charts render within 1 second
- Large dataset charts render within acceptable time limits
- Interactive features respond without noticeable delay
- Memory usage remains within specified limits

## Dependencies / Impact

### Dependencies:
- Existing chart rendering infrastructure (Recharts library)
- Data processing and analysis capabilities
- Export functionality from other requirements
- Responsive design framework (Tailwind CSS)

### Impact on Existing Codebase:
- VisualizationPanel.tsx will need significant updates
- New chart components will need to be created
- Chart service layer will need expansion
- UI components will need chart type selection interfaces

### Related Systems:
- Recharts library for chart rendering
- D3.js for advanced chart features (if needed)
- Chart export functionality
- Responsive design system

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Approach:
- Phase 1: Implement basic advanced chart types
- Phase 2: Add interactive features and customization
- Phase 3: Optimize performance and responsiveness
- Phase 4: Polish and advanced features

### Technical Considerations:
- Use WebGL for very large dataset rendering if needed
- Implement virtual scrolling for extremely large datasets
- Consider chart lazy loading for better performance
- Implement chart caching for frequently accessed visualizations

### Future Considerations:
- 3D visualization capabilities
- Real-time data streaming charts
- Custom chart creation tools
- Advanced animation and transition effects

### Risk Mitigation:
- Test with various dataset sizes and types
- Implement progressive enhancement for complex features
- Provide fallback options for unsupported chart types
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize accordingly
