## Background / Context
The current application has performance limitations when handling large datasets, with potential browser crashes and slow response times. The application lacks optimization techniques such as data pagination, lazy loading, memory management, and background processing. Users experience slow performance, unresponsive UI, and memory issues when working with datasets larger than 10,000 rows. This requirement addresses the need for efficient handling of large datasets and optimal performance.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive performance optimization and scalability features that enable the application to handle large datasets efficiently, maintain responsive user interface, and provide smooth user experience regardless of data size.

## Scope

### Included:
- Data pagination and virtualization for large datasets
- Lazy loading and code splitting for components
- Memory optimization and garbage collection
- Background processing for heavy computations
- Caching and memoization strategies
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Bundle size optimization and compression

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Server-side processing (client-side only)
- Database optimization (localStorage only)
- Cloud computing integration (future requirement)
- Advanced caching with Redis (future requirement)

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Pagination & Virtualization
The system must implement efficient data pagination and virtual scrolling to handle datasets with millions of rows without loading all data into memory. Users should be able to navigate through large datasets smoothly with minimal memory usage.

### Requirement 2: Lazy Loading & Code Splitting
The system must implement lazy loading for components and code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve application startup time. Components should only load when needed, improving overall performance.

### Requirement 3: Memory Management
The system must implement efficient memory management including garbage collection, memory monitoring, and cleanup procedures. Memory usage should remain under 500MB even for large datasets.

### Requirement 4: Background Processing
The system must implement background processing for heavy computations using Web Workers to prevent UI blocking. Long-running operations should not impact user interface responsiveness.

### Requirement 5: Caching & Optimization
The system must implement intelligent caching strategies for frequently accessed data, computed results, and user preferences. Cache invalidation and management should be automatic and efficient.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Non-functional requirement 1: Performance
- Page load time must be under 2 seconds
- Time to interactive must be under 3 seconds
- Large dataset processing (1M+ rows) must complete within 30 seconds
- UI responsiveness must be maintained during heavy operations

### Non-functional requirement 2: Scalability
- Application must handle datasets up to 1 million rows
- Memory usage must remain under 500MB for large datasets
- Performance degradation must be linear, not exponential

### Non-functional requirement 3: Reliability
- Application must not crash due to memory issues
- Performance must remain consistent across different devices
- Error handling must gracefully manage performance issues
- Fallback options must be available for performance-critical features

### Non-functional requirement 4: User Experience
- Loading states must be clearly indicated to users
- Progress indicators must show accurate completion status
- Performance issues must be communicated clearly
- Users must be able to cancel long-running operations
