## Date
January 11, 2025

## Background / Context
The current application lacks comprehensive data validation and quality assessment capabilities. Users cannot verify data integrity, identify quality issues, or receive automated suggestions for data cleaning. This leads to potential errors in analysis results and reduced confidence in insights. This requirement addresses the need for robust data validation, quality metrics, and automated data cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive data validation, quality assessment, and automated data cleaning capabilities to ensure the highest accuracy and reliability of data analysis results, providing users with confidence in their data quality and analysis outcomes.

## Scope

### Included:
- Automated data type validation and format consistency checks
- Comprehensive data quality metrics and scoring
- Advanced outlier detection and statistical validation
- Automated data cleaning suggestions with confidence scores
- Data quality dashboard and reporting capabilities
- Custom validation rules and threshold configuration
- Data quality trend analysis and monitoring

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Real-time data streaming validation (batch processing only)
- Advanced machine learning for data cleaning (rule-based only)
- External data quality services integration (local processing only)
- Automated data correction without user approval

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Data Validation
The system must automatically detect and validate data types, formats, ranges, and patterns for all uploaded datasets. Validation should include data type consistency, format standardization, range validation, and cross-column relationship checks.

### Requirement 2: Data Quality Assessment
The system must calculate and display comprehensive data quality metrics including completeness, consistency, uniqueness, accuracy, and timeliness. Quality scores should be provided with detailed breakdowns and visual representations.

### Requirement 3: Automated Data Cleaning
The system must provide intelligent suggestions for data cleaning operations including outlier handling, missing value imputation, data standardization, and format normalization. All suggestions must include confidence scores and user approval workflows.

### Requirement 4: Quality Reporting & Monitoring
The system must provide detailed quality reports, trend analysis, and a comprehensive quality dashboard. Reports should be exportable and include actionable recommendations for quality improvement.

### Requirement 5: Custom Validation Rules
The system must allow users to define custom validation rules, quality thresholds, and business logic for specific data requirements. Custom rules should integrate seamlessly with built-in validation.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Non-functional requirement 1: Performance
- Validation processes must complete within 5 seconds for datasets up to 100,000 rows
- Quality assessment should not significantly impact overall analysis performance
- Batch processing for large datasets with progress indicators

### Non-functional requirement 2: Usability
- Clear visual indicators for data quality issues and validation results
- Intuitive interface for reviewing and approving data cleaning suggestions
- Detailed explanations for each validation rule and quality metric
- Ability to customize validation rules and thresholds

### Non-functional requirement 3: Reliability
- Validation rules must be deterministic and reproducible
- Quality metrics should be consistent across different data formats
- Graceful handling of edge cases and malformed data
- Comprehensive error logging and debugging information

### Non-functional requirement 4: Accuracy
- Data type detection must achieve 95% accuracy
- Quality metrics must be mathematically sound and validated
- Outlier detection must use appropriate statistical methods
- Validation results must be consistent and reliable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptance criterion 1: Data Validation
- System automatically detects data type mismatches with 95% accuracy
- Cross-column validation identifies relationship violations
- Custom validation rules can be defined and applied
- Validation results are clearly displayed with actionable insights

### Acceptance criterion 2: Quality Assessment
- Data quality score is calculated and displayed prominently
- Quality metrics cover all major dimensions (completeness, consistency, accuracy)
- Quality trends are tracked and visualized over time
- Quality reports can be exported in multiple formats

### Acceptance criterion 3: Data Cleaning
- Automated cleaning suggestions are provided with confidence scores
- Users can review and approve cleaning actions before execution
- Cleaning history is maintained and can be audited
- Data integrity is preserved during cleaning operations

### Acceptance criterion 4: User Experience
- Quality issues are prioritized by impact and severity
- Clear explanations are provided for each quality metric
- Users can customize quality thresholds and validation rules
- Quality improvement recommendations are actionable and specific

### Acceptance criterion 5: Performance & Reliability
- Validation completes within specified time limits
- Quality assessment does not block analysis workflow
- System handles edge cases gracefully
- All operations are logged for debugging and audit

## Dependencies / Impact
