## Background / Context
The current application provides basic statistical analysis but lacks robust statistical methods, confidence intervals, and uncertainty quantification. Users cannot assess the reliability of statistical results or understand the precision of their analysis. This leads to potentially misleading conclusions and reduced confidence in statistical insights. This requirement addresses the need for robust statistics, confidence intervals, error propagation analysis, and comprehensive statistical validation.

## Objective
Enhance statistical analysis capabilities with robust statistical methods, confidence intervals, error propagation analysis, and uncertainty quantification to provide more reliable and trustworthy data insights that users can confidently rely on for decision-making.

## Scope

### Included:
- Robust statistical measures resistant to outliers and extreme values
- Confidence intervals for all statistical measures and estimates
- Error propagation analysis and uncertainty quantification
- Advanced statistical validation and assumption testing
- Comprehensive statistical reporting with professional standards
- Bootstrap methods and resampling techniques
- Statistical power analysis and sample size calculations

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Advanced statistical modeling beyond basic regression
- Bayesian statistical methods (frequentist approach only)
- Real-time statistical monitoring (batch analysis only)
- External statistical service integration (local computation only)

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Statistical Methods
The system must implement outlier-resistant statistical measures including robust means, medians, trimmed means, and robust regression methods. These methods should provide reliable statistics even when data contains outliers or extreme values.

### Requirement 2: Confidence Intervals & Uncertainty
The system must calculate and display confidence intervals for all statistical measures, prediction intervals for regression models, and tolerance intervals where appropriate. All statistical results must include uncertainty quantification.

### Requirement 3: Error Propagation Analysis
The system must identify sources of uncertainty in data analysis, implement mathematical models for error propagation through calculations, and provide sensitivity analysis to understand how input uncertainties affect output results.

### Requirement 4: Advanced Statistical Validation
The system must test statistical assumptions, provide comprehensive model diagnostics, implement cross-validation methods, and conduct goodness-of-fit tests to ensure statistical methods are appropriate and reliable.

### Requirement 5: Statistical Reporting & Interpretation
The system must provide comprehensive statistical summaries with confidence intervals, calculate effect sizes, generate professional statistical tables, and offer guidance for interpreting statistical results correctly.
