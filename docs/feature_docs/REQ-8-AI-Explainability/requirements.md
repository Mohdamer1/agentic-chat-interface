## Background / Context
The current application provides AI-powered insights but lacks transparency into how the AI reaches conclusions. Users cannot understand the reasoning behind AI recommendations, assess confidence levels, or verify the reliability of AI-generated insights. This leads to reduced trust in AI outputs and potential misuse of AI-generated recommendations. This requirement addresses the need for explainable AI, model transparency, and interpretability to build user trust and enable responsible AI usage.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive AI model interpretability and explainability features to make AI insights transparent, trustworthy, and actionable. Users should understand how the AI reaches conclusions, what factors influence decisions, and have confidence in the reliability of AI-generated insights.

## Scope

### Included:
- AI decision path visualization and reasoning explanation
- Feature importance ranking and attribution analysis
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification
- Bias detection and fairness assessment
- Interactive AI exploration and what-if analysis
- Model performance monitoring and quality metrics
- Explainable AI techniques (LIME, SHAP, or equivalent)

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Advanced machine learning model training
- Real-time model retraining and updates
- External AI service integration (local AI only)
- Advanced bias mitigation algorithms (detection only)

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Model Transparency
The system must provide clear visibility into AI decision-making processes including decision paths, feature importance rankings, confidence scores, and underlying reasoning. All AI insights must be accompanied by transparency metrics and explanations.

### Requirement 2: Explainable AI Techniques
The system must implement multiple explainable AI techniques including local interpretability for individual predictions, global interpretability for overall model behavior, and counterfactual explanations showing how changes affect outcomes.

### Requirement 3: AI Validation & Trust
The system must provide comprehensive model performance metrics, bias detection capabilities, fairness assessment, and robustness testing to ensure AI models are reliable, unbiased, and trustworthy.

### Requirement 4: Interactive AI Exploration
The system must allow users to interactively explore AI decisions through what-if analysis, sensitivity analysis, and custom scenario testing. Users should be able to drill down into specific AI decisions and understand influencing factors.

### Requirement 5: AI Quality Assurance
The system must provide a comprehensive quality metrics dashboard, real-time performance monitoring, error analysis, and model comparison capabilities to ensure continuous AI model improvement and reliability.
