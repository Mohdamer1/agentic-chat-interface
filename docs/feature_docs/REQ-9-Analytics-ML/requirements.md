## Background / Context
The current application provides basic statistical analysis and EDA capabilities but lacks advanced analytical features such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning capabilities. Users cannot perform sophisticated statistical analysis, predictive modeling, or advanced data exploration. This requirement addresses the need for professional-grade analytical tools and machine learning capabilities.

## Objective

- Regression analysis (linear, logistic, multiple regression)
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering)
- Predictive modeling and classification
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model performance metrics and validation

### Explicitly Excluded:
- Custom model training (uses pre-trained models)
- Deep learning capabilities (basic ML only)
- Real-time model deployment (analysis only)
- Advanced model optimization (basic validation only)
